# Site updates

I started with this site about a year ago when I was thinking about looking for a new job. It was essentially being used as a glorified business card. I have decided to come back to this site to try out some new things and write about some of the stuff I've been working on.

This site is built usingn jekyll, so I'm not currently planning on writing a lot of new code for the site. The main things I'll be focusing on are:

- Sass and sass organization
- New css techniques
- Design

These are threee things that I could use to become better at and I hope to use this site as a way to try out some new things.

As well as trying out some new things on here, I am hoping also hoping to start writing about some of my findings in development. Anything from work spaces to javascript to spacemacs and hopefully some other things I haven't learned yet.

I'm looking forward to start writing more, now if only I can keep up with it.
